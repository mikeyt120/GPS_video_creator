    "### Data Gathering Process\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need:\n",
    "- GPS device or smartphone which is waterproof (or inside a waterproof bag).\n",
    "- Waterproof camera (e.g. Go Pro)\n",
    "- Kayak\n",
    "- Camera attachment to Kayak. I've used an adjustable fishing rod holder with an extendable Go Pro pole to allow the Go Pro to be extended below the water. Whatever mount you use you should still tether the camera to the kayak in case it breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Turn on the GPS device and wait for a good signal lock. If possible, set the GPS device to capture a fixed high sample rate (e.g. 1Hz).\n",
    "2. Start recording on your GPS device.\n",
    "3. Start the camera recording at a low frame rate with an acceptable resolution. I find 1080 resolution with 30fps worked well on my Go Pro.\n",
    "4. Film the time on your phone to the nearest second. This will allow you to synchronize the timing between the devices later.\n",
    "5. Position the camera so that it is submerged enough not to be obstructed by surface bubbles. Direction of camera should be straight down.\n",
    "6. Paddle over the region you want to survey. It is ideal if you have a GPS tracker with a live map display showing you where you have paddled. This allow you to make sure you cover the whole region.\n",
    "7. After finishing the paddle, turn the camera off and the GPS device off (order of turning them off doesn't matter).\n",
    "8. Download the camera video file to your computer and save in this directory (Video file). \n",
    "9. Download the GPS file and convert it to a .gpx file. Save the .gpx file in this directory (GPS file). My GPS device produces a .fit file. To convert that to a .gpx file I upload it to my Strava account, then export as a .gpx file from Strava.\n",
    "10. Watch the camera video file and pause the video when it shows the time on your phone or GPS device (from step 4). Note the time of the video when the watch time changes to the next second. Subtract the time of the video from the watch time to get the starting time of the video (start_time).\n",
    "11. Export a Georeferenced Image from Nearmaps which covers the whole region you surveyed. Choose the GDA2020 projection. Choose a resolution of 0.597m/pixel or lower. Save the .jpg file from the zip file in this directory (Map image).\n",
    "12. Follow remainig steps in this jupyter notebook."
