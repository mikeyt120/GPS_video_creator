    "Adds a map with live GPS position according to the position of the camera used for the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Gathering Process\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need:\n",
    "- GPS device or smartphone which is waterproof (or inside a waterproof bag).\n",
    "- Waterproof camera (e.g. Go Pro)\n",
    "- Kayak\n",
    "- Camera attachment to Kayak. I've used an adjustable fishing rod holder with an extendable Go Pro pole to allow the Go Pro to be extended below the water. Whatever mount you use you should still tether the camera to the kayak in case it breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1.\tTurn on the GPS device and wait for a good signal lock. If possible, set the GPS device to capture a fixed high sample rate (e.g. 1Hz).\n",
    "2.\tStart recording on your GPS device.\n",
    "3.\tStart the camera recording at a low frame rate with an acceptable resolution. I find 1080 resolution with 30fps worked well on my Go Pro.\n",
    "4.\tFilm the time on your phone to the nearest second. This will allow you to synchronize the timing between the devices later.\n",
    "5.\tPosition the camera so that it is submerged enough not to be obstructed by surface bubbles. Make sure the camera is pointing in the direction you want to film.\n",
    "6.\tPaddle over the region you want to survey. It is ideal if you have a GPS tracker with a live map display showing you where you have paddled. This allows you to make sure you cover the whole region.\n",
    "7.\tAfter finishing the paddle, turn the camera off and the GPS device off. The order of turning them off doesn't matter.\n",
    "8.\tDownload the camera video file (Video file) and save in an accessible directory (vid_dir_name).\n",
    "9.\tDownload the GPS file and convert it to a .gpx file. Save the .gpx file in this directory (GPS file). My GPS device produces a .fit file. To convert that to a .gpx file I uploaded it to my Strava account, then export as a .gpx file from Strava.\n",
    "10.\tWatch the Video file and pause the video when it shows the time on your phone or GPS device (from step 4). Note the time of the video when the device time changes to the next second. Subtract the time of the video from the device time to get the starting time of the video (start_time).\n",
    "11.\tExport a georeferenced image from mapping software which covers the whole region you surveyed. I used Nearmaps. For Nearmaps, choose the GDA2020 projection. Choose a resolution of 0.597m/pixel or lower. Save the .jpg file (Map image) and .jgw file from the zip file in this directory. If using other mapping software you just need to make sure you have the equivalent .jgw file values to match your map image.\n",
    "12.\tFollow remaining steps in this Jupyter Notebook."
