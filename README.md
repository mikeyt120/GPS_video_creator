## Python libraries required:
- gpxpy
- numpy
- cv2

## Online tools required:
- https://geodesyapps.ga.gov.au/grid-coordinate-batch-processing - created by Geoscience Australia, licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode
- Mapping software which provides a georeferenced map image (I used Nearmaps for this example).
- Video editing software (I used OpenShot Video Editor for this example).

## Equipment required:
- GPS device or smartphone which is waterproof (or inside a waterproof bag).
- Waterproof camera (e.g. Go Pro)
- Kayak
- Camera attachment to Kayak. I've used an adjustable fishing rod holder with an extendable Go Pro pole to allow the Go Pro to be extended below the water. Whatever mount you use you should still tether the camera to the kayak in case it breaks.
